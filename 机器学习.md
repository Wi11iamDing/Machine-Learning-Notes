# Machine Learning



## Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems.

-  In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some **continuous function**. 

- In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into **discrete categories**.

  

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.

With unsupervised learning there is **no feedback** based on the prediction results.



## Univariate Linear Model

 **(Linear Regression with One variable)**



## Cost Function

We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a **cost function**. This takes an average difference (actually a fancier version of an average) of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's and the actual output y's.
$$
J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \dfrac {1}{2m} \displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^m \left ( \hat{y}_{i}- y_{i} \right)^2 = \dfrac {1}{2m} \displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^m \left (h_\theta (x_{i}) - y_{i} \right)^2
$$
To break it apart, it is $\frac{1}{2}\bar{x}$ where $\bar{x}$ is the mean of the squares of $h_\theta (x_{i}) - y_{i}$ , or the difference between the predicted value and the actual value.

This function is otherwise called the "Squared error function", or "Mean squared error". The mean is halved $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$ as a convenience for the computation of the gradient descent, as the derivative term of the square function will cancel out the $\frac{1}{2}$ term. 

Goal:minimize function J 



## Gradient Descent

The gradient descent algorithm is:

repeat until convergence:
$$
\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta_0, \theta_1)
$$
where

j=0,1 represents the feature index number.

At each iteration j, one should simultaneously update the parameters $\theta_1, \theta_2,...,\theta_n$. Updating a specific parameter prior to calculating another one on the $j^{(th)}$ iteration would yield to a wrong implementation.

**Learning Rate**: the size of each step is determined by parameter $\alpha$, which is called learning rate.



## Matrix

matrix is a two dimensional array

### matrix multiplication properties

- Matrix are not commutative: $A*B \neq B*A$
- Matrices are associative: $(A∗B)∗C = A∗(B∗C)$
